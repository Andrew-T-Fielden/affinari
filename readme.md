# Affinari: The Semantic Affinity Engine

Affinari is a context-aware semantic matching and negotiation engine designed to align **seekers** and **providers** based on evolving shared meaning.

Unlike traditional recommender systems that optimise for popularity, similarity, or engagement, Affinari focuses on **fit, alignment, and discovery** — making it possible to uncover non-obvious, high-context matches that resonate deeply.

## 🔍 Core Principles

- **Localised Matching**  
  All matches are contextual and scenario-specific — not universalised or static.

- **Shared Attribute Space**  
  Seekers express *desirability* across attributes; providers express *applicability* — forming a mutual semantic interface.

- **Evolving Interpretation**  
  Affinari refines its understanding of what preferences mean over time — adjusting weightings, interpreting intent, and learning from outcomes.

- **Doppelganger Discovery**  
  Users with similar sensibilities are identified to surface surprising, serendipitous options and uncover latent alignment.

- **Symmetric Empowerment**  
  Both seekers and providers shape their profiles. Providers can highlight who they’re best for — and who they’re not for.
