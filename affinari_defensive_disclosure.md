# Affinari: Defensive Disclosure and Prior Art Summary

## Summary

Affinari is a semantic matching and negotiation engine designed to facilitate high-resolution alignment between **seekers** and **providers** based on **shared attributes**, **evolving interpretation**, and **doppelganger-informed discovery**.

Unlike traditional recommender systems or rule-based matchmaking engines, Affinari operates in a **mutual, evolving, and context-sensitive space** that prioritises **alignment over popularity**, and **meaningful connection over engagement optimisation**.

This document provides a formal defensive disclosure to:

- Establish **prior art**
- Protect the core concepts from future patent encroachment
- Support potential IP claims or filings

## Core Claims of Novelty

### 1. **Desirability–Applicability Matching**
- Seekers express **desirability** for attributes
- Providers express **applicability** for the same attributes
- A **shared attribute space** forms the semantic interface
- Matching is **contextual**, not absolute (e.g., a loud venue may be desirable in one scenario, undesirable in another)

### 2. **Localised Matching & Affinari Engine**
- All matches are **local to the scenario**, not universalised rankings
- A central **Affinari Engine** acts as **intermediary**, interpreting mutual fit based on declared and inferred preferences
- The engine is **interpretive, not directive** – it brokers alignment, not authority

### 3. **Evolving Interpretation**
- Seeker and provider profiles can **evolve over time**, including:
  - Re-weighting of attributes
  - Refinement based on prior outcomes
  - Interpretation of attribute *meaning* as it relates to each actor
- The system models **preference-as-process**, not preference-as-fact

### 4. **Doppelganger Discovery**
- Affinari identifies **users with high semantic similarity**
- These doppelgangers act as **proxy explorers**, surfacing options a user might not directly encounter
- The mechanism enables **indirect discovery** without reducing users to aggregate behaviour

### 5. **Symmetrical Support for Seekers and Providers**
- The system is designed to **benefit both sides**:
  - Seekers find relevant, often surprising matches
  - Providers reach the right audience without chasing generic excellence
- Providers can tune their own **Affinari profiles** to clarify who they’re best for — and who they’re not for

## Differentiation from Prior Art

### A. **Traditional Recommender Systems**
- Optimise for engagement, not mutual fit
- Driven by popularity, ratings, or item-item similarity
- Do not support shared attribute negotiation or evolving profiles

### B. **Matchmaking Platforms**
- Typically rule-based or fixed-profile matching (e.g., job sites, dating apps)
- Often treat user preferences as static or binary
- Lack interpretive mediation, doppelganger inference, or semantic evolution

### C. **Academic Multi-Agent Preference Systems**
- Conceptually related (e.g., CP-nets, utility graphs)
- Rarely implemented in commercial systems
- Do not function as live, evolving matching ecosystems

### D. **LLM-Based Systems**
- General-purpose language agents (e.g., GPT-4) excel at extraction, not alignment
- Lack persistent or structured user-provider affinity models
- Affinari can integrate with LLMs but provides a **meaning-making layer** they do not possess

---

## Additional Protections

- Project name **Affinari** is a coined term, with no known prior use in AI systems. A trademark filing is planned.
- A private GitHub repository exists to store dated concept versions, conversation logs, and diagrams
- Conversations with GPT-4 (ChatGPT) are timestamped and exported as supporting documentation of ideation

---

## Future Patent or Trademark Scope

Potential areas for IP protection may include:

- Matching engine logic (desirability-applicability)
- Doppelganger inference mechanism
- Semantic negotiation process for evolving fit
- UI/UX models for affinity-based scenarios

---

## Closing Statement

This document asserts and records the **originality**, **structure**, and **intent** of the Affinari system. It is not intended to block open innovation but to **protect the right to build and steward Affinari responsibly**, and to **prevent third parties from claiming ownership of concepts that are already in use and development.**
